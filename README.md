   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guide
- Open the `Getting Started.ipynb` notebook to see how to use the model for image classification.

## Dataset Information
- The dataset consists of images categorized into two folders: `happy` and `sad`.

## Model Information
